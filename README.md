# Hi, I’m Ashley Scruse

I’m a grant writer, educator, and creative technologist working at the intersection of education, automation, and digital entrepreneurship. I lead academic programs in data science and machine learning, and I build digital products and AI-powered tools to help solopreneurs and founders streamline their systems and scale sustainably.

## I’m interested in...
- No-code and low-code automation tools (like Make, Airtable, and Relevance AI)
- Python education for beginners, especially in research-focused contexts
- AI agents for content generation, email marketing, and lead workflows
- Digital product ecosystems for creator-led businesses
- Designing tools that balance strategy, storytelling, and software

## I’m currently learning...
- How to package and sell AI-powered SaaS tools for small business owners
- How to integrate GPT agents with structured databases for content workflows
- Advanced Python concepts to support research training at scale
- Full-site customization and backend logic for web applications

## I’m building...
- A founder-led brand site that shares my journey through career, self-learning, and entrepreneurship—while housing my content, digital products, and tools
- Essential AI agents solopreneurs and founders can use to scale their business and buy back time
- Academic programs focused on Python, data science, and applied machine learning for beginners and early-stage researchers

## I’m open to collaborating on...
- Grant-funded education initiatives in data science, machine learning, and computing
- Open source tools that make AI and automation more accessible to non-technical users
- Guest teaching, technical writing, and speaking opportunities focused on automation and digital business

## Fun fact
I learned Python by teaching it—and now I teach automation by using it to run my own business. I also believe everything is easier with the right template, whether it's for tech, teaching, or to-do lists.
